# VS-Net: Variable splitting network for accelerated parallel MRI reconstruction 

The code in this repository implements VS-Net (Fig.1), a model-driven neural network for accelerated parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, we formulate the generalized parallel compressed sensing reconstruction as an energy minimization problem, for which a variable splitting optimization method is derived. Based on this formulation we propose a novel, end-to-end trainable deep neural network architecture by unrolling the resulting iterative process of such variable splitting scheme. We evaluated VS-Net on complex valued multi-coil knee images for 4-fold and 6-fold acceleration factors (Fig.2).

## 1. Overview
The files in this repository are organized into 5 directories and 1 root directory:
* root : contains base functions for training, validation, inference and visualizaiton:
  * network architecture, as shown in Fig.1 - [architecture.py](architecture.py)
  * data loader to read complex-valued raw MRI data and sensitivity maps - [data_loader.py](data_loader.py)
  * inference to deploy a trained model on unseen raw data - [inference.py](inference.py)
  * save png images for visualization after inference - [save_png.py](save_png.py)
  * train and validate the VS-Net - [vs_net.py](vs_net.py)
* [common](common) : contains dependant functions used in training or deploying VS-Net and is written by [fastMRI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI) with some of my modificatins
* [data](data) : contains dependant functions used in training or deploying VS-Net and is writen by [fastMRI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastMRI)
* [log](log) : produces `csv` files where the quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM and NMSE) over iterations are saved
* [model](model) : saves trained models. There are 4 pre-trained models that can be used directly to see VS-Net performance.
* [results](results) : save final results. After inference is run, this folder will produce 3 mat files, i.e. vs-200.mat, zero_filling.mat and reference.mat. On top of the three mat files, running [save_png.py](save_png.py) will produce png files.
